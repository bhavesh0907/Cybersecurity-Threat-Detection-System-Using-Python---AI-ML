# Cybersecurity Threat Detection System

## Overview
The **Cybersecurity Threat Detection System** is an AI/ML-based tool designed to detect potential security threats by analyzing file attributes and behavior. It includes feature extraction, machine learning model training, and real-time threat assessment to classify files as safe or malicious.

## Features
- 🔍 **Real-Time Threat Detection** – Analyzes file attributes and behavior to identify potential threats.
- 🧠 **Machine Learning Model** – Utilizes AI to classify files as safe or malicious.
- 📊 **Feature Extraction** – Extracts relevant security-related features from files.
- 🚀 **Automated Threat Assessment** – Provides real-time threat intelligence.
- 🌐 **Web Interface** – User-friendly Flask-based dashboard for monitoring threats.
