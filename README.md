About:

The Cybersecurity Threat Detection System is an AI/ML-based tool designed to detect potential security threats by analyzing file attributes and behavior. It includes feature extraction, machine learning model training, and real-time threat assessment to classify files as safe or malicious.

Features:

🛡 Threat Classification – AI-driven detection of safe and malicious files.

🔍 Feature Extraction – Analyzes file attributes and behavior patterns.

📊 Machine Learning Models – Uses trained models for real-time assessment.

🚀 Real-Time Detection – Provides immediate threat classification results.

🛠 Customizable Models – Supports various ML algorithms.
