Overview

The Cybersecurity Threat Detection System is an AI/ML-based tool designed to analyze file attributes and behavior to detect potential security threats. It leverages feature extraction, machine learning model training, and real-time threat assessment to classify files as safe or malicious.

Features

🛡 Threat Classification – Identifies malicious files using AI-driven analysis.

🔍 Feature Extraction – Extracts key attributes from files for analysis.

📊 Machine Learning Models – Uses trained ML models to assess threats.

🚀 Real-Time Detection – Provides instant classification results.

🛠 Customizable Algorithms – Supports multiple machine learning techniques.
